# 5C_Reviews
A collection of 5C big data reviews based on S. Keshav's [How to Read a Paper](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee384m/Handouts/HowtoReadPaper.pdf).

The "5C"'s in the paper are based on a first pass reading of a paper. The key points for the first pass include:

1) Carefully read the title, abstract, and introducion

2) Read the section and sub-section headings, but ignore everything else

3) Read the conclusions

4) Glance over the references, mentally ticking off the ones you've already read

The five Cs are:

1) *Category*: What type of paper is this?

2) *Context*: Which other papers is it related to? Which theoretical bases were used to analyze the problem?

3) *Correctness*: Do the assumptions appear to be valid?

4) *Contributions*: What are the paper's main contributions?

5) *Clarity*: Is the paper well written?
